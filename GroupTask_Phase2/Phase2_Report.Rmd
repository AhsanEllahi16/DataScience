# Introduction

This report presents **Phase 2** of the group assignment, which focuses on  
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **visualization** using the World Bank dataset
prepared in Phase 1.

The dataset covers years **2000-2024** and includes:

- **Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)**  
- **Real interest rate (%)**

The goal is to explore trends, distributions, outliers, and relationships.

# Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Load dataset created in Phase 1
data <- read.csv("GroupTask_Phase1/Phase1_combined_clean.csv")

Data Overview
Writing
# Show the first few rows

head(data)

# Count missing values

colSums(is.na(data))

# Summary statistics

summary(data)

Distribution of Inflation
Writing
ggplot(data, aes(x = inflation)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
labs(title = "Distribution of Inflation (2000-2024)",
x = "Inflation (%)",
y = "Count") +
theme_minimal()

Distribution of Interest Rate
Writing
ggplot(data, aes(x = interest_rate)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.7) +
labs(title = "Distribution of Interest Rate (2000-2024)",
x = "Interest Rate (%)",
y = "Count") +
theme_minimal()

Boxplots - Outlier Detection
Writing
ggplot(data, aes(y = inflation)) +
geom_boxplot(fill = "tomato") +
labs(title = "Inflation - Boxplot",
y = "Inflation (%)") +
theme_minimal()

ggplot(data, aes(y = interest_rate)) +
geom_boxplot(fill = "purple") +
labs(title = "Interest Rate - Boxplot",
y = "Interest Rate (%)") +
theme_minimal()

Relationship Between Inflation and Interest Rate
Writing
ggplot(data, aes(x = inflation, y = interest_rate)) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "blue") +
labs(title = "Inflation vs. Interest Rate",
x = "Inflation (%)",
y = "Interest Rate (%)") +
theme_minimal()

Trend Over Time (Global Average)
Writing
trend <- data %>%
group_by(year) %>%
summarise(
avg_inflation = mean(inflation, na.rm = TRUE),
avg_interest = mean(interest_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
)

ggplot(trend, aes(x = year)) +
geom_line(aes(y = avg_inflation), color = "red", size = 1) +
geom_line(aes(y = avg_interest), color = "blue", size = 1) +
labs(title = "Global Trend: Inflation vs. Interest Rate",
x = "Year",
y = "Average Value") +
theme_minimal()

Key Findings

Inflation shows wide variation with multiple outliers.

Interest rate distribution is skewed and includes negative values.

Scatter plot indicates a weak positive relationship between inflation and interest rate.

Global inflation spikes during crisis years like 2008 and 2020.

Interest rates generally decline after 2010.

Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully completed:

Data exploration

Missing value analysis

Summary statistics

Distribution and outlier analysis

Relationship visualization

Time-series trend analysis

This prepares the dataset for Phase 3: Statistical Modeling.
