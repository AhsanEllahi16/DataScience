## Objective
Perform linear regression to analyze relationship between inflation and interest rates, and validate the model using diagnostic plots.

## Data
We use the cleaned dataset from Phase 1 (2000-2024) containing inflation and real interest rates per country.

## Steps

1. Import cleaned data from Phase 1.
2. Select relevant variables: inflation and interest_rate.
3. Remove missing values.
4. Fit linear regression model: inflation ~ interest_rate.
5. Generate diagnostic plots to validate assumptions.

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Load dataset
data <- read_csv("../data/Phase1_cleaned_data.csv")

# Prepare model data
model_data <- data %>%
  select(country, year, inflation, interest_rate) %>%
  drop_na()

# View sample
head(model_data)

# Fit model

model <- lm(inflation ~ interest_rate, data = model_data)

# Model summary

summary(model)

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  # 2x2 layout
plot(model)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  # reset layout

Interpretation of Diagnostic Plots

Residuals vs Fitted:
Residuals are mostly scattered around zero, showing a reasonable linear relationship.

Normal Q-Q Plot:
Residuals are close to the line, slightly deviating at extreme values.

Scale-Location Plot:
Mild heteroskedasticity is visible, which is common in economic data.

Residuals vs Leverage:
A few high-leverage points exist but do not dominate the model.

Diagnostic Conclusion

Overall, the model assumptions are reasonably satisfied. Minor deviations are expected due to volatility in country-level economic data.
